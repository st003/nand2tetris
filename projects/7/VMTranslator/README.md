# VMTranslator

A VM translator for Nand2Tetris' stack-based VM instructions written in the Python programming language. This implementation only supports the requirements for project 7. The full implementation can be found in project 8.

_Note: Python used to simplify the assignment submission proccess. I would have preferred to write this in Go._
